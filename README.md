PROJECT PROPOSAL: PERSONAL HEALTH DATA ANALYSIS

PROJECT TITLE

EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND STEP COUNT USING PERSONAL HEALTH DATA

OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to analyze personal health data exported from Apple Health and investigate the hypothesis:
"As the temperature increases, the daily step count also increases."

MOTIVATION

Understanding how external factors like weather influence daily physical activity is crucial for improving health and wellness. This analysis will help identify trends that can inform personal lifestyle adjustments or broader health studies.

METHODOLOGY

DATA COLLECTION
Health Data: Personal data such as step count, heart rate, and sleep patterns will be extracted from the export.xml file exported from Apple Health.
Weather Data: Historical temperature data will be obtained from a reliable weather API or CSV dataset for the corresponding dates.
DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING
Use Python libraries such as Pandas to parse and clean the health data.
Synchronize the health data with daily temperature records.
EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
Visualize step counts and temperature trends over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Compute basic statistics like mean, median, and correlation between step count and temperature.
HYPOTHESIS TESTING
Conduct statistical tests to determine if there is a significant relationship between temperature and step count.
VISUALIZATION
Create scatter plots, heatmaps, and line graphs to illustrate findings clearly.
INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Summarize key trends and provide actionable insights based on the analysis.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Graphs showing the relationship between step count and temperature.
Statistical validation of the hypothesis.
Insights into how external factors like weather influence physical activity.
TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Scipy
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Weather Data Source: OpenWeatherMap API or a similar resource for historical temperature data.
