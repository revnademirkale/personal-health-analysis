PROJECT PROPOSAL: MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE ANALYSIS


EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MENSTRUAL CYCLE PHASES AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE USING PERSONAL HEALTH DATA

OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to analyze personal health data and investigate the hypothesis:
"Energy expenditure decreases during certain phases of the menstrual cycle."

MOTIVATION

Understanding how physiological factors such as the menstrual cycle influence energy expenditure is essential for optimizing health and wellness routines. This analysis aims to provide insights that could lead to more personalized recommendations regarding physical activity and energy consumption throughout the cycle.

METHODOLOGY

DATA COLLECTION

Health Data: Personal health data such as step count, heart rate, calories burned, and sleep patterns will be extracted from the exported .xml file from Apple Health.
Menstrual Cycle Data: Data on menstrual cycle phases, including the onset of menstruation and ovulation dates, will be gathered manually or using cycle-tracking apps that can export data.

DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING

Use Python libraries like Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.
Synchronize the menstrual cycle data with daily health metrics (step count, calories burned, etc.).
Filter out irrelevant data and handle any missing values.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Visualize energy expenditure trends across different menstrual cycle phases using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Compute basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for energy expenditure during the follicular, ovulatory, luteal, and menstrual phases.
Investigate the correlation between menstrual cycle phase and energy expenditure using appropriate metrics.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING

Perform statistical tests (such as t-tests or ANOVA) to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in energy expenditure between the different phases of the menstrual cycle.

VISUALIZATION

Create scatter plots, box plots, and line graphs to clearly show the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and energy expenditure.
Develop heatmaps to explore patterns over time.

INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Summarize the key findings and provide actionable insights on how menstrual cycle phases might impact energy expenditure and physical activity.
Offer personalized recommendations for women based on the analysis.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Graphs and visualizations showing the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and energy expenditure.
Statistical evidence supporting or refuting the hypothesis.
Insights into how the menstrual cycle affects daily energy expenditure and physical activity patterns.

TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Data Sources: Apple Health export files for health data, menstrual cycle data from tracking apps or manual input.

Findings: What I Learned About Myself
Through this project, I learned about the fluctuations in energy expenditure across different phases of the menstrual cycle. By analyzing 4 years of personal health data, I gained insights into which phases of the menstrual cycle lead to increases or decreases in energy expenditure. This extensive dataset allowed me to achieve more reliable results and make meaningful conclusions. Additionally, I realized the importance of long-term data collection for drawing accurate insights, as the 4-year data provided a solid foundation for analyzing trends and patterns. This project deepened my understanding of how data analysis can uncover patterns related to personal health and physiological cycles.

Limitations and Future Work: What Could Be Done Better?
One limitation of this project is the relatively small and subjective dataset, especially concerning menstrual cycle data, which is manually recorded or tracked by apps. This can lead to potential biases and inaccuracies. Additionally, external factors such as physical activity intensity, diet, and sleep quality were not fully integrated into the analysis, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between menstrual phases and energy expenditure.

For future work, it would be beneficial to:

Expand the dataset by including more diverse and comprehensive data points (e.g., physical activity levels, dietary information, sleep patterns).
Increase the sample size to make the findings more generalized.
Incorporate machine learning techniques like classification or clustering to predict energy expenditure during different phases more accurately.
Integrate more variables that could potentially affect energy expenditure, such as stress levels or medication use, to make the model more robust and reliable.
