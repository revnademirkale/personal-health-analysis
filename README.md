Project Proposal: Menstrual Cycle and Energy Expenditure Analysis
Exploring the Relationship Between Menstrual Cycle Phases and Energy Expenditure Using Personal Health Data
Objective
The primary aim of this project is to analyze personal health data and investigate the hypothesis: "Energy expenditure decreases during certain phases of the menstrual cycle."

Motivation
Understanding how physiological factors, such as the menstrual cycle, influence energy expenditure is crucial for optimizing health and wellness routines. By analyzing personal health data, this study aims to provide valuable insights that can contribute to more personalized recommendations regarding physical activity, energy consumption, and overall wellness throughout the menstrual cycle.

Methodology
Data Collection
Health Data: Personal health data, including step count, heart rate, calories burned, and sleep patterns, will be extracted from the exported .xml file from Apple Health.
Menstrual Cycle Data: Data on menstrual cycle phases, including the onset of menstruation and ovulation dates, will be gathered manually or using cycle-tracking apps that provide exportable data.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data will be cleaned and preprocessed using Python libraries such as Pandas.
Synchronizing the menstrual cycle data with daily health metrics (e.g., step count, calories burned) will be necessary.
Irrelevant data will be filtered out, and missing values will be handled appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize energy expenditure trends across different menstrual cycle phases using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for energy expenditure across the follicular, ovulatory, luteal, and menstrual phases.
Analyze the correlation between menstrual cycle phases and energy expenditure using suitable metrics.
Hypothesis Testing
Conduct statistical tests such as t-tests or ANOVA to evaluate whether significant differences in energy expenditure exist between the different phases of the menstrual cycle.
Visualization
Create scatter plots, box plots, and line graphs to clearly display the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and energy expenditure.
Develop heatmaps to explore time-based patterns and their impact on energy expenditure.
Insights and Recommendations
Summarize key findings and provide actionable insights into how menstrual cycle phases influence energy expenditure and physical activity.
Offer personalized recommendations for women based on the analysis.
Expected Outcomes
Visualizations such as graphs and charts illustrating the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and energy expenditure.
Statistical evidence supporting or refuting the hypothesis.
Insights into how the menstrual cycle affects daily energy expenditure and physical activity patterns.
Technologies and Tools
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Data Sources: Apple Health export files for health data, menstrual cycle data from tracking apps or manual input
Findings: What I Learned About Myself
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the fluctuations in energy expenditure across different phases of the menstrual cycle. By analyzing 4 years of personal health data, I learned which phases of the cycle tend to increase or decrease energy expenditure. The extensive dataset provided reliable results, enabling me to draw meaningful conclusions.

This project highlighted the importance of long-term data collection, as having a 4-year dataset allowed me to analyze trends and patterns with greater accuracy. It also deepened my appreciation for the role of data analysis in uncovering patterns related to personal health and physiological cycles, which can have real-world implications for optimizing health management strategies.

Limitations and Future Work: What Could Be Done Better?
While this project offers valuable insights, several limitations should be addressed:

Data Limitations: The dataset, especially regarding menstrual cycle data, is subjective and may include biases due to manual tracking or app limitations.
External Factors: The analysis could have been improved by considering additional factors like physical activity intensity, diet, or sleep quality, which might have a more significant impact on energy expenditure.
Future Work
Expand the dataset by integrating more comprehensive data points (e.g., physical activity levels, dietary information, sleep patterns).
Increase sample size for more generalized and robust findings.
Incorporate machine learning techniques such as classification or clustering to predict energy expenditure more accurately during different menstrual phases.
Add more variables like stress levels or medication use to create a more holistic and reliable model.
