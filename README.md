PROJECT PROPOSAL: MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE ANALYSIS
PROJECT TITLE

EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MENSTRUAL CYCLE PHASES AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE USING PERSONAL HEALTH DATA

OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to analyze personal health data and investigate the hypothesis:
"Energy expenditure decreases during certain phases of the menstrual cycle."

MOTIVATION

Understanding how physiological factors such as the menstrual cycle influence energy expenditure is essential for optimizing health and wellness routines. This analysis aims to provide insights that could lead to more personalized recommendations regarding physical activity and energy consumption throughout the cycle.

METHODOLOGY

DATA COLLECTION

Health Data: Personal health data such as step count, heart rate, calories burned, and sleep patterns will be extracted from the exported .xml file from Apple Health.
Menstrual Cycle Data: Data on menstrual cycle phases, including the onset of menstruation and ovulation dates, will be gathered manually or using cycle-tracking apps that can export data.
DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING

Use Python libraries like Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.
Synchronize the menstrual cycle data with daily health metrics (step count, calories burned, etc.).
Filter out irrelevant data and handle any missing values.
EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Visualize energy expenditure trends across different menstrual cycle phases using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Compute basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for energy expenditure during the follicular, ovulatory, luteal, and menstrual phases.
Investigate the correlation between menstrual cycle phase and energy expenditure using appropriate metrics.
HYPOTHESIS TESTING

Perform statistical tests (such as t-tests or ANOVA) to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in energy expenditure between the different phases of the menstrual cycle.
VISUALIZATION

Create scatter plots, box plots, and line graphs to clearly show the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and energy expenditure.
Develop heatmaps to explore patterns over time.
INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Summarize the key findings and provide actionable insights on how menstrual cycle phases might impact energy expenditure and physical activity.
Offer personalized recommendations for women based on the analysis.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Graphs and visualizations showing the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and energy expenditure.
Statistical evidence supporting or refuting the hypothesis.
Insights into how the menstrual cycle affects daily energy expenditure and physical activity patterns.
TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Data Sources: Apple Health export files for health data, menstrual cycle data from tracking apps or manual input.
