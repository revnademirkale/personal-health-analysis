Findings: What I Learned About Myself
Through this project, I learned about the fluctuations in energy expenditure across different phases of the menstrual cycle. By analyzing 4 years of personal health data, I gained insights into which phases of the menstrual cycle lead to increases or decreases in energy expenditure. This extensive dataset allowed me to achieve more reliable results and make meaningful conclusions. Additionally, I realized the importance of long-term data collection for drawing accurate insights, as the 4-year data provided a solid foundation for analyzing trends and patterns. This project deepened my understanding of how data analysis can uncover patterns related to personal health and physiological cycles.
